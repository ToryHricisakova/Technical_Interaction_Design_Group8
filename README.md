CrossConnect is a social media platform inspired by LinkedIn, where the focus is on the section of the workforce with a cross-disciplinary background (such as the Software Design people). The platform simultaneously serves as a place where graduates can seek career inspiration from working professionals, as well as see which degree combinations are most sought after by employers by
researching the available job posts for different degree combinations. Our platform would help young graduates choose the most advantageous degree combinations by connecting them with professionals from similar backgrounds who have gone on to study diverse
subjects.
